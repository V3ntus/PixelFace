# Tizen Pixel Watch Face
Trying to imitate the Pixel Watch face for my Galaxy Watch Active (and other Tizen based watches)

Must have Tizen CLI tools installed: https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/download

Due to Samsung's poor documentation, I'm not sure how to deploy this to your emulator or physical device via CLI, so just do it in Tizen Studio for now
